# Snake2D
 A classic game of snake, where you navigate a hungry serpent through a grid-based world, eating food and avoiding obstacles. This game is built using C# and Unity. I created this game to practice my Unity development skills and learn from the community. Feel free to play, learn from, and contribute to the code!
